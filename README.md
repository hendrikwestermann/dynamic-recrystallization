# A non-equilibrium thermodynamic framework for viscoplasticity incorporating dynamic recrystallization at large strains  
Minimal code example of the publication "A non-equlibirium thermodynamic framework for viscoplasticity incorporating
dynamic recrystallization at large strain" published in [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijplas.2021.102988](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijplas.2021.102988) by 
Rolf Mahnken and Hendrik Westermann from Paderborn University.

This is not the code for the final numerical examples in the paper, but rather first attempts in matlab.
The strains are prescibed in order to work on the internal variables. The theory is small strains is used. The final examples are done in Fortan 77
with an in-house FEM programm.

# Usage
Default Matlab
